Cognitive Forge

Cognitive Forge is a modular reasoning framework that transforms AI prompts into structured, multi-agent cognitive environments ‚Äî all within a single prompt window. It enables transparent, self-reflective, and collaborative reasoning using symbolic agents, spatial geometries, protocols, and memory structures.

‚öôÔ∏è No plugins. No external APIs. 100% prompt-based cognition.

üîß What It Does

Enables multi-agent prompting inside a single LLM session

Uses symbolic geometries to route and organize reasoning

Implements protocols for agent handoff, validation, and synthesis

Simulates memory systems (e.g., working memory, long-term decay)

Provides transparent reasoning chains, not black-box outputs

üß© Core Components

Component

Description

Agents

Roles like Gatekeeper, Weaver, Thresholder, and Observer perform specialized tasks

Geometries

Spatial/topological reasoning flows (e.g., spirals, radial constellations)

Protocols

Govern coordination, iteration, validation, and recursion across agents

Memory

Models symbolic recall, decay, and persistence using structured prompt design

Meta-Observer

Oversees alignment, coherence, and cognitive traps during reasoning

Explain complex systems (e.g. how AlphaGo beat a human) using multi-agent retrospection

Iterative debugging with Weaver ‚Üî Gatekeeper self-correction loop

Spiral geometry prompting to explore ‚Üí converge on complex topics

Memory geometries like torus buffers or radial maps for symbolic state management

üß† Why Use the Forge?

‚úÖ Transparent, modular reasoning

‚úÖ Simulates symbolic cognition

‚úÖ Fully in-prompt, no setup needed

‚úÖ Enhances code generation, philosophy, economics, and more

‚úÖ Compatible with all major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.)

üì¶ Getting Started

The Forge is a prompting framework, not a software package.

You can begin by copying example prompts or agent templates from /prompt-modules into your LLM of choice. Then:

Define the roles and geometry. more geometries can be found in the /prompt geometries 

Route tasks to appropriate agents.

Use protocol logic to manage validation and iteration.

Simulate memory using structured token prompts or metaphorical layouts.

Reflect using the Meta-Observer agent.
