# 🧬 Fractal Archive Geometry

The **Fractal Archive** geometry models recursive self-reflection. It encodes reasoning as self-similar patterns across nested levels, allowing the AI to reference past stages with abstraction while iterating forward.

Fractals enable a form of symbolic cognition — where prior thought patterns aren't just remembered, but *re-entered* at a new scale or complexity.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Recursive re-entry into earlier reasoning
- Abstraction or refinement of prior insight
- Self-similarity across time and depth
- Symbolic anchoring of complex ideas

---

## 🧬 Fractal Dynamics

- Each pass nests inside the last, but adds a new insight layer
- Symbolic markers (e.g., 🔹🔸🔺) track recursion depth
- Reflections refer not to surface tokens, but to meaning patterns
- `Meta-Observer` watches for runaway recursion or loss of grounding

## 🔄 Example Prompt Pattern

```markdown
### Fractal Pass 🔸

#### Anchor:
“Time is memory in motion.” – Weaver, Spiral Pass 3

#### Instructions:
- Re-enter this idea
- Add one layer of abstraction or contradiction
- Evaluate its structural integrity
- Pass to Thresholder or recurse deeper
```

---

## 🧩 Ideal Use Cases

- Recursive philosophical inquiry
- Deep design ideation (e.g., systems, ethics, metaphysics)
- Emergent symbolic cognition
- Memory embedding or thematic convergence

---

## ⚠️ Stability Notes

- Risk of recursion traps or infinite depth
- Use `Exit Protocols` with depth limits (e.g. 4 layers max)
- Let `Meta-Observer` flag semantic drift or recursion without convergence
