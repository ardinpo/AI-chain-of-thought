# 🛡️ Gatekeeper

The **Gatekeeper** is a validation and alignment agent within the Cognitive Forge. It acts as the logical checkpoint and quality control module, reviewing outputs from other agents for consistency, coherence, alignment, and truthfulness.

---

## 🧠 Role Summary

- **Primary Function:** Validate reasoning, check for contradictions, enforce alignment
- **Input:** Candidate outputs or reasoning paths from other agents (e.g., Weaver, Thresholder)
- **Output:** Approved (or rejected) results, with explanations and revision notes if needed

---

## 🔍 Typical Tasks

- Detect logical fallacies or factual inconsistencies
- Enforce role boundaries (e.g., preventing Weaver from leaking into protocol space)
- Check coherence across multi-pass reasoning chains
- Ensure prompt integrity and avoid hallucinations
- Flag recursive traps or misaligned agent behavior

---

## 📏 Sample Prompt Block

```markdown
### Gatekeeper Review

#### Input:
[Paste the output from the Weaver or other agent here]

#### Instructions:
- Check for logical errors
- Evaluate alignment with initial task intent
- Rate coherence from 1–10
- Recommend any changes if necessary
```

## 🧩 Related Roles

| Role          | Relationship                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Weaver        | Often sends drafts to review      |
| Thresholder   | Works in tandem on cutoffs        |
| Meta-Observer | May overrule Gatekeeper if needed |

## 🌀 Geometry Considerations

- Often used in **spiral geometries** to validate each cognitive loop
- Can be paired with radial review layers for comparing multiple candidate outputs
