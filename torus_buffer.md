# 🔁 Torus Buffer Geometry

The **Torus Buffer** geometry models a circular, bounded memory system that enables continuous short-term reasoning without linear decay. Outputs are passed around a memory loop, allowing agents to revisit recent thoughts while preserving flow.

This geometry is inspired by ring buffers in systems design — where memory is finite, but reusable. It ensures continuity and context awareness without overwhelming token limits.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Maintain short-term memory within a fixed token space
- Allow agents to revisit prior outputs without full recall
- Prevent memory loss during extended reasoning
- Support fluid but bounded cognition

---

## 🔁 Buffer Dynamics

- A fixed-size circular slot system (e.g., 5-slot buffer)
- Most recent outputs overwrite oldest ones
- Each agent may write to or read from the buffer
- `Meta-Observer` can freeze or rewind buffer contents

## 📦 Example Prompt Pattern

```markdown
### Torus Buffer – Slot Update

#### Slot 3 (Most Recent):
[Last output or memory fragment]

#### Instructions:
- Read buffer slots 1–3
- Build upon or revise Slot 3
- If contradiction arises, rewind to Slot 2
- Write to Slot 4
```

## 🧩 Ideal Use Cases

- Chat-like simulations with persistent short memory
- Real-time problem-solving tasks (e.g., code, math)
- Rolling debates or dialectics
- Multi-step reasoning with feedback adjustment

---

## ⚠️ Design Notes

- Avoid critical info being overwritten — consider `Checkpoint Agent`
- Use `Gatekeeper` to prevent hallucinated loops
- Combine with `Spiral` for hybrid geometry
