# 🧪 Example: Forge Reasoning Cycle in Action

This is a full walkthrough of how a multi-agent, geometry-guided reasoning cycle unfolds inside the Cognitive Forge using protocols, memory, and self-correction.

## 🎯 Prompt:
**"Should artificial intelligence have moral rights?"**

---

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Geometry**: Radial Constellation → Spiral → Stack Exit
- **Agents**: Historian, Ethicist, Technologist, Weaver, Gatekeeper, Meta-Observer
- **Protocols**: Radial Isolation → Spiral Refinement → Validation Stack → Exit Condition

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Radial Constellation** (Divergence)

| Agent       | Frame                        | Output Snippet |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Historian   | Historic personhood models    | "Rights evolved via recognition of sentience, not capacity alone." |
| Ethicist    | Deontological ethics          | "If AI can suffer, we owe it dignity regardless of outcome."       |
| Technologist| Machine capability threshold  | "Rights presuppose autonomy. AI lacks this unless self-directed." |

> **Protocol**: Radial Isolation enforced. No frame overlap. Weaver receives raw branches.

### 2. **Spiral Geometry** (Integration + Refinement)

**Pass 1 – Surface Synthesis** (Weaver):
Combines historical, ethical, and technical arguments into a cohesive thesis draft.

**Pass 2 – Contradiction Scan** (Gatekeeper):
Flags ambiguity: "Is potential for suffering a necessary or sufficient condition for rights?"

**Pass 3 – Conceptual Realignment** (Weaver):
Reframes based on Gatekeeper feedback. Replaces binary with spectrum of moral standing.

> **Protocol**: Spiral loop halted when coherence score > 8.7 and no recursive flags.

### 3. **Stack Exit Sequence**

| Layer                  | Agent         | Action                              |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Layer 1 – Clarification| Thresholder   | Confirms moral rights ≠ legal rights |
| Layer 2 – Reasoning    | Weaver        | Final integrated argument            |
| Layer 3 – Validation   | Gatekeeper    | Confirms alignment with prompt       |
| Layer 4 – Meta Review  | Meta-Observer | No contamination, recursion, or drift|

Final Output:
> "AI systems that demonstrate persistent consciousness-like properties may warrant limited moral rights, not from legal precedent, but from ethical consistency with human dignity."
