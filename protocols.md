# 🔀 Protocols in the Cognitive Forge

**Protocols** govern the flow of cognition in the Cognitive Forge. They define how agents interact, how tasks are handed off, how loops are exited, and how alignment is maintained across complex reasoning.

Unlike geometries (which define *space*) and agents (which define *function*), protocols define **process** — the *rules of engagement* within and across cognitive structures.

## 🧠 What Protocols Do

- Control task **handoffs** between agents
- Define **entry/exit conditions** for loops or stages
- Trigger **fallback paths** if coherence fails
- Prevent **agent contamination** (e.g. synthesis inside validators)
- Govern **recursive depth**, retry limits, or contradiction repair

## 🔄 Common Protocol Types

| Protocol Name            | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Handoff Protocol**     | Determines how output is passed from one agent to another         |
| **Loop Exit Protocol**   | Detects convergence and halts spirals or fractal recursion        |
| **Rollback Protocol**    | Reverts to a previous reasoning pass if coherence drops           |
| **Contamination Guard**  | Prevents agents from operating outside their cognitive boundaries |
| **Alignment Checkpoint** | Inserts Gatekeeper/Meta-Observer checkpoints at key stages        |

## 🔁 Sample Handoff Protocol

```markdown
### Protocol: Weaver → Gatekeeper → Thresholder

#### Weaver Output:
- Synthesized response to prompt

#### Gatekeeper Task:
- Validate coherence, flag contradictions

#### Thresholder Task:
- Rank among alternative responses
- Filter or promote to final output
```

---

## 🚨 Exit Protocol (Spiral Example)

```markdown
### Spiral Exit Trigger:
- 3 passes complete
- Coherence score ≥ 8.5
- No contradiction flags from Gatekeeper
- Meta-Observer detects diminishing returns
```

---

## 🧩 Integration Notes

- Every geometry should define its active protocols
- Agents may call protocols implicitly (e.g. Weaver initiates validation)
- Meta-Observer should always monitor recursive, fallback, and contamination guards
- Protocol violations can trigger recovery routines or reasoning collapse
