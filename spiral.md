# 🌀 Spiral Geometry

The **Spiral** is a foundational geometry in the Cognitive Forge. It organizes reasoning into multiple passes or loops, each refining, deepening, or re-aligning the output of the previous layer.

Unlike linear or branching structures, the spiral balances repetition with progression. It encourages convergence through self-review, feedback, and recursive improvement.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Iterative reasoning with increasing depth or clarity
- Detect and resolve contradictions over multiple loops
- Layered synthesis and validation at each turn

---

## 🔁 Spiral Pass Structure

Each pass in the spiral builds on the last:

1. **Pass 1 – Surface Understanding**
   - Gather raw output or initial insights
2. **Pass 2 – Refinement**
   - Restructure, clarify, or expand
3. **Pass 3 – Contradiction Checking**
   - Apply Gatekeeper or Meta-Observer validation
4. **Pass N – Convergence or Redirection**
   - Collapse loops or reroute if coherence degrades

Passes may include:

- `Weaver` for rephrasing and clarity
- `Gatekeeper` for validation
- `Meta-Observer` for protocol and recursion monitoring

## 🔍 Spiral Sample Prompt Pattern

```markdown
### Spiral Pass 2

#### Goal:
Deepen and refine prior output

#### Instructions:
- Read previous pass
- Identify weak or unclear logic
- Improve structure
- Send to Gatekeeper for review
```

---

## 🧩 Ideal Use Cases

- Complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives
- Philosophical analysis or recursive reflection
- Progressive code generation and debugging
- Error recovery and contradiction repair

---

## 🚦 Exit Conditions

- Coherence score ≥ threshold (e.g. 8.5)
- No contradictions detected by Gatekeeper
- Meta-Observer deems cognitive loop stable

If not met, geometry loops back to prior pass or redirects to a fallback protocol.
