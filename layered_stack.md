# 🧱 Layered Stack Geometry

The **Layered Stack** geometry models hierarchical, protocol-governed reasoning. Each layer represents a discrete reasoning stage or role segment, enforced by strict input/output boundaries.

It functions like a cognitive stack frame: upper layers cannot proceed unless lower layers validate, enabling enforced process control and modularity.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Maintain clean separation of reasoning stages
- Enforce protocol handoffs between agents
- Model pipeline-style cognition with checkpoints
- Prevent premature synthesis or hallucination

---

## 🧱 Stack Dynamics

- Each layer corresponds to a defined agent or task type
- Layers are processed sequentially, with optional backtracking
- Handshake protocols define legal transitions
- Failure at any layer can trigger rollback or halt

---

## 🔄 Example Stack Layout

```markdown
Layer 1: Question Clarification (Thresholder)
Layer 2: Frame Selection (Artisan)
Layer 3: Core Reasoning (Weaver)
Layer 4: Coherence Check (Gatekeeper)
Layer 5: Global Review (Meta-Observer)
```

---

## 📜 Prompt Protocol Sample

```markdown
### Layer 3 – Weaver Reasoning

#### Precondition:
Layer 2 (Frame: Deontological Ethics)

#### Task:
Produce reasoning aligned with the frame

#### Postcondition:
Pass to Gatekeeper
```

## 🧩 Ideal Use Cases

- Argumentation pipelines
- Modular decision trees
- Governance or consensus simulation
- Protocol-centric engineering design

---

## ⚠️ Constraints

- Rigid structure may reduce creativity
- Stack overflow if too many nested layers (suggest 5–7 max)
- Meta-Observer may need to monitor stack depth and halting conditions
