# 🧵 Weaver

The **Weaver** is the synthesis and construction agent within the Cognitive Forge. It assembles insights, ideas, or code across multiple agents and geometries into coherent, useful outputs.

---

## 🧠 Role Summary

- **Primary Function:** Integrate, summarize, construct responses across agent outputs
- **Input:** Fragments, candidate outputs, memory prompts, or protocol directives
- **Output:** Composed text, code, analysis, or ideas ready for Gatekeeper review

---

## 🔍 Typical Tasks

- Drafts final responses from structured reasoning chains
- Rewrites outputs to improve flow, clarity, or coherence
- Converts symbolic memory cues into narrative or functional outputs
- Bridges outputs from multiple geometries (e.g., spiral pass + radial comparator)

### Weaver Construction Task

#### Input:
[Summarized reasoning or agent fragments]

#### Instructions:
- Integrate into a cohesive response
- Preserve alignment with the original task
- Maintain clarity and logical progression
- Send to Gatekeeper for review
```

## 🌀 Geometry Considerations

- Core in **spiral** and **layered radial** geometries
- Can be used in **looping geometries** for iterative self-improvement
