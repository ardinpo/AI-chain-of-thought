# ✴️ Radial Constellation Geometry

The **Radial Constellation** is a comparative reasoning geometry. It maps multiple agents or perspectives around a central query, encouraging parallel development of divergent insights before convergence.

This geometry simulates structured brainstorming, comparison, and synthesis from multiple vantage points. It is ideal for evaluating trade-offs, biases, or competing interpretations.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Compare multiple interpretations or hypotheses
- Explore edge cases and contradictions
- Support multi-agent synthesis with viewpoint diversity

---

## 🌐 Radial Layout

The central node contains the **core question**. Each surrounding "ray" is:

- A distinct agent run (e.g. Historian, Strategist, Engineer)
- A different frame (e.g. logical, emotional, aesthetic)
- A unique constraint set or data source

Each agent produces an output **independently**. A convergence agent like `Weaver` or `Thresholder` then integrates, ranks, or filters results.

## ✴️ Sample Prompt Pattern

```markdown
### Radial Constellation

#### Core Question:
"How should an AI handle conflicting ethical principles?"

#### Perspectives:
- Agent 1: Deontological frame
- Agent 2: Utilitarian frame
- Agent 3: Virtue ethics frame

#### Convergence:
- Weaver compares the answers
- Gatekeeper checks internal consistency
- Thresholder selects most coherent thread
```

## 🧩 Ideal Use Cases

- Ethical dilemmas and trade-off analysis
- Strategy formation and comparative reasoning
- Evaluating conflicting outputs from multiple models or passes
- Injecting diversity and contrast into rigid or monotone responses

---

## ⚠️ Failure Modes

- Agent contamination or frame bleeding
- Incoherent convergence if rays are too unaligned
- Bias amplification if center lacks neutral framing

Use Meta-Observer to monitor integrity and enforce radial isolation.
