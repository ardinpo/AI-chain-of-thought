# 🧠 Agents in the Cognitive Forge

**Agents** are the active cognitive modules in the Cognitive Forge framework. Unlike traditional "roles" that merely describe intent or voice, agents are structured **cognitive functions** — each with its own inputs, outputs, purpose, and interaction protocols.

An agent is not just a persona. It is a *functional cognitive unit* designed to operate within geometries, follow protocols, interact with memory, and be validated by other agents.

## 🔧 What Makes an Agent?

An agent in the Forge is defined by:

- **Purpose** – What cognitive function it serves (e.g. synthesis, filtering, validation)
- **Inputs/Outputs** – What it expects to receive, and what it generates
- **Geometry Compatibility** – Which cognitive layouts it thrives in (spiral, radial, stack...)
- **Protocol Alignment** – How it hands off or receives tasks
- **Memory Interaction** – Whether it writes to, queries, or ignores memory systems
- **Self-limiting Boundaries** – What it explicitly avoids doing (e.g. no synthesis from a validator)

## 🔄 Agents vs. Roles

| Feature            | Agent                                 | Role                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Functionality       | Operational cognitive unit             | Style, tone, or behavioral overlay     |
| Bound by Protocols | Yes                                    | No                                     |
| Geometry-aware     | Yes (acts differently in spiral vs radial) | No                                  |
| Memory-integrated  | Yes (can read/write symbolic memory)   | Rarely                                 |
| Self-validating    | Yes, via Gatekeeper or Meta-Observer   | No                                     |

## 🧩 Agent Classes (Examples)

| Agent Name     | Function                          | Example Output Style                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Weaver**     | Synthesize and structure content  | Rewrites, summaries, convergence        |
| **Gatekeeper** | Validate coherence and alignment  | Flags contradictions or drift           |
| **Thresholder**| Prune weak outputs or rank results| Filters, scorecards, cutoff reports     |
| **Meta-Observer** | Monitor process, recursion, protocol drift | Logs, override alerts, route changes |
| **Artisan**    | Refine aesthetic, emotional, or poetic quality | Styled outputs, metaphors         |

## 🛠 Agent Design Tips

- Give each agent **clear boundaries** — no multitasking unless intentional
- Define **handoff rules** (e.g. Weaver → Gatekeeper → Thresholder)
- Assign agents to **geometry-specific slots**
- Use `Meta-Observer` to enforce specialization and avoid contamination
