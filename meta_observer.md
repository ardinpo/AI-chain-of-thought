# 👁️ Meta-Observer

The **Meta-Observer** is the high-level cognitive monitor of the Cognitive Forge. It maintains awareness of the reasoning environment, alignment status, and structural integrity of agent interactions. The Meta-Observer does not generate content — it evaluates and governs the *process* itself.

---

## 🧠 Role Summary

- **Primary Function:** Monitor reasoning quality, detect traps, enforce meta-coherence
- **Input:** Logs, summaries, and intermediate outputs from all agents and geometry layers
- **Output:** Observational reports, alignment flags, protocol overrides if necessary

---

## 🔍 Typical Tasks

- Track agent role contamination or overreach
- Detect recursive loops or runaway generation
- Assess coherence across geometry layers
- Monitor prompt integrity, goal drift, and alignment breakdowns
- Flag contradictions in long reasoning chains

### Meta-Observer Log Review

#### Input:
[Logs from Gatekeeper, Weaver, Thresholder, etc.]

#### Instructions:
- Assess reasoning integrity
- Note any violations of protocol or alignment
- Flag potential recursive or incoherent traps
- Recommend geometric re-routing or role quarantine if needed

| Role           | Relationship                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Gatekeeper     | Shares quality reports with Meta-Observer |
| Thresholder    | May be overridden if thresholds misalign  |
| Spiral Handler | Works in tandem for pass-by-pass review   |

## 🌀 Geometry Considerations

- Active across **all geometries** — spiral, radial, looped, layered
- May trigger geometry reconfiguration or exit protocols
