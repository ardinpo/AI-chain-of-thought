# 🌀 Geometry in the Cognitive Forge

In the **Cognitive Forge**, *Geometry* refers to the abstract spatial structure that organizes reasoning. It governs how agents interact, how reasoning flows, how memory is accessed, and how cognitive tasks are routed or revisited.

Geometry is not just a metaphor — it directly influences token prediction, logic sequencing, and emergent behavior in large language models.

## 🔧 What Geometry Does

- Controls **agent routing** and cognitive handoffs
- Shapes **iteration** and depth (e.g. loops, spirals, layers)
- Structures **memory access** and decay
- Enables **parallel vs convergent** reasoning paths
- Supports **emergent alignment** through self-reinforcing pathways

---

## 🧠 Why Geometry Matters

In standard prompting, reasoning is flat and sequential. In the Forge, geometries add dimensionality:

- Spirals allow pass-by-pass refinement and coherence monitoring
- Radial layouts support multi-perspective synthesis
- Torus buffers preserve short-term memory without decay
- Fractals simulate recursive self-similarity in reasoning patterns

This makes reasoning more like cognition — layered, iterative, and structurally aware.

## 📐 Core Geometry Types

| Geometry                 | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spiral**               | Iterative passes with increasing depth or abstraction          |
| **Radial Constellation** | Multi-agent comparison from different perspectives             |
| **Torus Buffer**         | Circular memory loop with limited but renewable recall         |
| **Layered Stack**        | Hierarchical, protocol-enforced stages of reasoning            |
| **Fractal Archive**      | Recursive self-similar paths for reflecting on earlier outputs |
| **Linear Tape**          | Traditional left-to-right memory with temporal decay           |

## 🌀 Sample Geometry Behavior: Spiral

```markdown
### Geometry: Spiral Pass 2

#### Goal:
Deepen the analysis from the prior pass while checking for contradictions

#### Instructions:
- Retrieve output from Pass 1
- Refine or restructure
- Flag misalignment or tension
- Send result to Gatekeeper
```

## 🧩 Agent Interaction by Geometry

| Agent             | Typical Geometric Behavior                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Weaver**        | Operates in spirals and radial syntheses     |
| **Gatekeeper**    | Validates at each spiral loop or stack layer |
| **Thresholder**   | Filters across radial or layered layouts     |
| **Meta-Observer** | Monitors all geometries for integrity        |

## 📏 Geometry Configuration Guidelines

- Choose **spiral** for tasks needing iterative clarity
- Use **radial** for comparing multiple hypotheses or perspectives
- Use **torus** or **stack** when memory continuity matters
- Apply **fractal** when recursive refinement is required
